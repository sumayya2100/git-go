Question 1: Agile Vs DevOps
Answer:
In Agile, we work iteratively and repeat these stages in each sprint of a release cycle:
-	Design
-	Develop
-	Test
After a defined/planned number of sprints, once we are ready with a version of the application/program, we release it and then finally Deploy in production. 
While in DevOps, we perform all these stages continuously in an iterative manner:
-	Design
-	Develop
-	Test
-	Deploy
Note: Major design is done prior to developing the software, however, design tweaks due to new features or feature enhancements, continues throughout the process.
